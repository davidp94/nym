// Package jobqueue is implemented based on eapache's infinite channel template:
// https://github.com/eapache/channels/blob/master/infinite_channel.go
// As explained by the author in documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/eapache/channels due to Go's type system
// limitations direct import of his library is impractical.
// This reimplementation allows more type safety due to having more strict channel type than an empty interface.
// On top of better, even though slightly slower, queue as now it is thread-safe which is crucial as the queue
// can be read by multiple workers.
